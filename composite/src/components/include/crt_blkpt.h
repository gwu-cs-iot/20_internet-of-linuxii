/***
 * The event count/block point is an abstraction to synchronize the
 * blocking behavior of different threads on abstract events. The
 * events are usually tied to a specific state of another
 * data-structure (into which the blkpt is embedded).  For example, a
 * lock is taken and released thus generating an event for any
 * blocking threads, or a ring buffer has a data item inserted into
 * it, thus generating an event for any threads waiting for
 * data. Concretely, we want a number of threads to be able to block,
 * and a thread to be able to wake up one, or all of them. The
 * challenge is solving a single race-condition:
 *
 * thd 0: check data-structure, determine the need for blocking and
 *        waiting for an event
 * thd 0: preemption, switching to thd 1
 * thd 1: check data-structure, determine that an event is generated
 * thd 1: call the scheduler, and wake all blocked threads (not
 *        including thd 0 yet)
 * thd 1: preempt, and switch to thd 0
 * thd 0: call scheduler to block
 *
 * The resulting state is that thd 1 should have unblocked thd 0, but
 * due to a race, the thd 0 will be blocked awaiting the *next* event
 * that may never come. Event counts are meant to solve this
 * problem. Traditional systems solve this problem using condition
 * variables and a lock around the scheduling logic, but if you want
 * to decouple the data-structure from the scheduler (e.g. as they are
 * in different modes, or components), this is a fundamental problem.
 *
 * The event count abstraction:
 *
 * Assume the data-structure generating events has at least three
 * states:
 * S0: available
 * S1: unavailable
 * S2: unavailable & subscribed
 *
 * The transitions within the data-structure are:
 * {S0->S1, S1->S0, S1->S2, S2->S0}
 *
 * Every transition into S0 is an abstract *event*. Threads that look
 * at the state of the data-structure, and must block waiting for its
 * state to change, wait for such an event to wakeup.
 *
 * The data-structure must define its own mapping to this state
 * machine. A few examples:
 *
 * Mutexes:
 * S0: Not locked.
 * S1: Locked and held by thread 0.
 * S2: Locked and held by thread 0, and threads 1...N contend the lock
 *
 * Ring buffer (for simplicity, assuming it never fills):
 * S0: data items in ring buffer
 * S1: no data in ring buffer
 * S2: no data in ring buffer, and thread(s) are waiting for data
 *
 * The event counts are used to track the threads that use the
 * data-structure when transitioning from S1->S2 (block thread), when
 * it is in S2 (block additional threads), and when it transitions
 * from S2->S0 (wakeup blocked threads).
 *
 * The event count is used in the following way:
 *
 * S0->S1:
 *     data-structure (DS) operation
 *     E.g. not locked -> locked, or
 *          dequeue from ring with single data item
 *
 * S1->S0:
 *     blkpt_checkpoint(ec) (not used)
 *     data-structure (DS) operation
 *     assert(blkpt_has_blocked(ec) == false) (as we're in S1)
 *     blkpt_trigger(ec) (won't do much as noone is blocked)
 *     E.g. unlock with no contention, or
 *          enqueue with no dequeuing threads
 *
 * S1->S2:
 *     cp = blkpt_checkpoint(ec)
 *     data-structure (DS) operation, determine we need to await event
 *     blkpt_wait(ec, cp)
 *     retry (this is why event counts can be used with lock-free data-structs)
 *     E.g. locked -> contended

 *          empty ring -> waiting for data
 *
 * S2->S0:
 *     data-structure (DS) operation
 *     assert(blkpt_has_blocked(ec) == true) (as we're in S2)
 *     blkpt_trigger(ec) (wake blocked threads!)
 *     E.g. unlock with contention, or
 *          enqueue with dequeuing threads
 *
 * Event count *optimization*:
 *
 * We prevent the race above using an epoch (count) for the events
 * thus the name. However, to avoid rapid wraparound on the epoch, we
 * only increment the epoch when the race condition is possible. That
 * is to say, we only increment the event count when the
 * data-structure has blocked threads. This not only delays
 * wraparound, it also will avoid an atomic instruction for all
 * operations that don't involve blocked threads (a common-case,
 * exemplified by futexes, for example).
 *
 * Usage optimization:
 *
 * Because of the event counter optimization to only use expensive
 * operations when triggering there are blocked threads, the user of
 * this API can trigger whenever transitioning back to S0.
